# File: average_vowels.py

# You’re curious about the average number of vowels compared to consonants in a paragraph.

# --- 1. Counting Vowels ---
# Write a return function that takes a string as input.
# The function should return a tuple containing:
#     (number of vowels, number of consonants)
# Name this function: counting_vowels_and_consonants()

def counting_vowels_and_consonants(sentence):
    vowels = 0
    consonants = 0
    for char in sentence:
        if char.isalpha():
            if char == "a" or char == "e" or char == "i" or char == "o" or char == "u" or char == "y":
                vowels += 1
            else:  
                consonants += 1
    return (vowels, consonants)

# Hint: You can use .isalpha() to check if a character is a letter.

# --- 2. Average Vowels ---
# Write a return function that takes in a paragraph (string) as input.
# The function should:
#   - Split the paragraph into individual sentences.
#   - Use counting_vowels_and_consonants() to count values for each sentence.
#   - Return a tuple: (number of sentences, average vowels per sentence, average consonants per sentence)
# Name this function: average_vowels_and_consonants()
